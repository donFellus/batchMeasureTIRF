# batchMeasureTIRF
This macro is designed to automatically segment, subtract background and measure standard parameters (based on the Analyze -> Set Measurements settings in ImageJ) from .vsi (can be modified to accommodate any filetype) files acquired by TIRF microscopy, and store the images as tiff files in subfolders in a destination folder.
